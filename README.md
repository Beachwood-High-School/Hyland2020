This was worked on at the Hyland Hackathon(Jan 3-5 2020) in Westlake, OH by the team from Beachwood High School.
The participants included
* Karmanyaah Malhotra @karmanyaahm
* Yue Yu @optimus222
* Evelyn Zhang @bunnyrabbit022
* Kai Zheng @kaiz715
* Michael Karpov @michaeldk975

The project was called EZWeather and was coded with python, tkinter,DarkSky(for weather) and Open Street Map (to parse address).
EZWeather helps reccomend clothing to people based on Weather. It was originally meant to use simple classification machine learning but ended up using a custom 'algorithm' which adapts to the user's preferences.

All code is in the Weather folder.
