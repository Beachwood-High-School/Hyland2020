This was worked on at the Hyland Hackathon(Jan 3-5 2020) in Westlake, OH by the team from Beachwood High School.
The participants included
* Karmanyaah Malhotra @karmanyaahm
* Yue Yu @optimus222
* Evelyn Zhang @bunnyrabbit022
* Kai Zheng @kaiz715
* Michael Karpov @michaeldk975

The project was called EZWeather and was coded with python, tkinter, DarkSky(for weather) and Open Street Map (to parse addresses).
EZWeather helps recommend clothing to people based on the weather. It was originally meant to use simple classification machine learning but ended up using a custom 'algorithm' which adapts to the user's preferences.

All code is in the Weather folder.

I know, it looks bad as it wasn't made to be responsive. This was originally coded on Mac OS (Mojave, I believe) on a 'Retina' display but these screenshots are with Breeze Dark and Breeze themes on KDE Plasma on a 1080p display.

Installation:
don't install this, it's bad  
darkskylib, geocoder, tkinter were some of the libraries used if you're still interested  
And use your own dark sky api key in Weather/weathertest.py
